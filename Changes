    version: 0.04
  - author: 'Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>'
    changes:
      - made things cleaner by using UNIVERSAL::require on the suspected module
      - 'The documentation now uses Test::More->builder->BAIL_OUT() in order to stop the testsuite from running if a compilation fails. Also, the documentation now urges that Test::Compile be mandatory (like Test::Exception often is) instead of optional (like Test::Pod often is).  Thanks to Rob Kinyon for the suggestion.'
      - bumped version numbers to '0.03'

  - author: 'Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>'
    changes:
      - 'made things cleaner by using UNIVERSAL::require on the suspected module name instead of do() on the file name, which introduced potential bugs by running at run time what would otherwise happen at compile time'
